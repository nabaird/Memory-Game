# Memory-Game
A game which becomes increasingly difficult in which the player must remember the correct order of colors presented to them 

The code is divided into two main sections. If guessing == true the player is currently entering an answer. If guessing == false the computer is showing the player the pattern they need to remember. 

The player gets a point for every correct answer. If a player guesses incorrectly the game is terminated and the player's score is printed in the serial moniter.
